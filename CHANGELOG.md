# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Note that released module versions are plain `x.y.z`: Ignition's `module.xml`
version parser is numeric-only and rejects a prerelease suffix at install time.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Dark mode for the Ignition 8.3+ Designer, toggled from **Tools → Dark Mode**
  and remembered between sessions.
- Apache-2.0 licensing, declared to the gateway as a free module with an EULA
  shown at install.
- CI (build, Gradle wrapper validation, `module.xml` wiring checks) and a
  tag-driven release workflow that signs and publishes the `.modl`.
- `ops/` scripts for a disposable Docker dev gateway, including unattended
  module acceptance so a fresh gateway needs no browser commissioning.
